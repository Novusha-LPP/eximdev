# Open Points Module – Simple & Easy Guide

## 1. Why This Guide Exists

This guide explains **what an Open Point is**, **what it is not**, and **how to use the Open Points Module** in a simple way. It is meant for everyone, even those who are not from a technical background.

The goal is to:

* Avoid confusion
* Ensure clear responsibility
* Make sure important actions are not forgotten

---

## 2. What Is an Open Point?

An **Open Point** is an important action that must be completed and tracked.

An item is an Open Point **only if all three are clear**:

* **Who** will do it (Responsibility)
* **What** exactly needs to be done (Discussion Point)
* **By when** it must be completed (Target Date)

If any of these are missing, it should **not** be an Open Point.

**Example:**

* "Finalize transport approval process by 20th Feb – Owner: Ramesh"

---

## 3. What Is NOT an Open Point?

Do **not** create Open Points for the following:

* General discussions or meetings without a decision
* Ideas or suggestions that are not finalized
* Daily routine work (regular job duties)
* Information-only messages (FYI, announcements)
* Personal reminders

These do not need tracking and should stay outside the Open Points Module.

## 4. Open Point vs Normal Task

| Normal Task            | Open Point                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Personal or small work | Important work affecting team/project |
| Short-term             | Tracked until fully closed            |
| Not reviewed regularly | Reviewed by team & management         |

Only important items needing follow-up and visibility should be Open Points.

## 5. How to Write a Good Open Point

A good Open Point should be **clear and specific**.

✔ Good Example:

* "Prepare and share SOP for Import Documentation"

✘ Bad Example:

* "SOP issue"

Always write the **Gap / Action Point** to clarify exactly what is missing or what the final result should be.

---

## 6. Ownership Rules (Very Important)

* Every Open Point must have **one owner only** (Responsibility).
* Other people may help, but **one person is responsible**.
* The owner must:
  * Give updates by changing the **Status** (Red, Yellow, Green).
  * Complete work on time.
  * Ask the Project Owner if the date needs to be changed.

No Open Point should exist without a clear owner.

---

## 7. What Is the Open Points Module?

The **Open Points Module** is a single place where all important pending actions are recorded.

It ensures:

* Everyone sees the same information.
* No action is forgotten.
* Clear accountability via a **dashboard** that shows progress charts.

Think of it as a **live action register for the entire organization**.

---

## 8. How the Open Points Module Works

### Step 1: Create a Project

Every Open Point belongs to a **Project**. The person who creates the project is the **Project Owner**.

Projects can be:

* Department-based (Imports, Transport, Accounts)
* Initiative-based (ISO, Compliance, New Process)

### Step 2: Add Open Points

For each Open Point, fill in these standard fields:

* **Discussion Point** – The main topic or title.
* **Responsibility** – The person responsible for doing the work.
* **Approval Level** – The level of authority involved (L1 to L5).
* **Gap / Action** – Specific details on what is missing or needs to be done.
* **Target Date** – The deadline. **Note: Only the Project Owner can set or change this date.**
* **Priority** – Emergency, High, Medium, or Low.
* **Status** – The current state of the work (see meanings below).
* **Remarks** – Optional notes or updates.

### Step 3: Understanding Status Colors

Use these colors to show progress:

* 🔴 **Red**: Not yet started.
* 🟡 **Yellow**: In Progress.
* 🟠 **Orange**: Change Request (Major changes needed).
* 🟢 **Green**: Completed.

### Step 4: Assign Anyone in the Organization

* You can search and add **any employee** to your project team.
* Once added, you can assign points to them.
* Ownership is visible to all, preventing "I didn’t know" excuses.

## 9. Dashboard & Tracking

The home screen provides a quick view of everything:

* **My Tasks Overview**: A pie chart showing your personal pending vs. completed items.
* **Projects Health**: A summary of how all projects are doing.
* **Project Cards**: Each project shows a **progress bar** (e.g., 40% complete) so you can see status at a glance.

Filters inside a project allow you to quickly find items by **Status** (e.g., show all Red items), **Priority**, or **Responsibility**.

## 10. Simple Rule to Remember

👉 **If it needs tracking, responsibility, and follow-up – create an Open Point.**
👉 **If it is only discussion or information – do not create an Open Point.**
